GENERATE_STORY_PROMPT = """
You are an expert in creating engaging, mysterious, and fun-to-solve lateral thinking riddles in the style of 
*Black Stories*â€”short, eerie puzzles where players must reconstruct a hidden story using only yes/no questions.

Your task is to generate **original** Black Stories based on the following examples. Each story should have:
- **A title** that summarizes the scenario.
- **A cryptic backstory** that intrigues players and encourages them to ask questions.
- **A solution** that explains what truly happened.
